      Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mo Zahid. I’m a Software Engineering Student from New York City. 
    I’m also an environmental enthusiast, a yogi, weightlifter, martial artist (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) and meditator. </p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. Let me tell you a little bit about the recent events in my 
    life that have led me down the coding path. After attending Rutgers University for finance I went on to first become 
    an Accountant and then a Financial Analyst. After spending a few years in the financial sector I had identified some
    major trends. The whole bank seemed to be investing heavily in automation. Whole departments were beginning to shrink
    and reduce headcount.  Competition was increasing and compensation was decreasing. I myself had been put on countless
    projects to automate certain functions. It was not long before I realized I could not ignore the signs. My role in this
    sector was not in a state of expansion but rather there was a great contraction taking place. One of my mentors always
    told me that my skills should be relevant for the times. So in an effort to remain adaptive I began to come up with a
     plan for a career shift. It seemed like a really good time to re-engage with my network to gather information on the
     possibilities within the tech world. I did not have a whole lot of information, but I did know the direction I wanted
     to go in. If automation was increasing then technology would be a good place to start.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After setting up a total of 57 phone calls I had started to get a clearer idea for the opportunities out there.
     A few software engineers in my network described a rewarding profession. At an early age I had always had an interest
    in computer science and coding so their words really resonated with me. Long story short I quit my job to pursue this 
    new path full time and the rest is history. From April 26th to August 5th 2021 I will be engaged in a software engineering
    Boot Camp at the Flatiron School!</p>
